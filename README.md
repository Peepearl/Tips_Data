# Tips_Data
### Business Understanding
Objective: The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize the tipping behavior in a restaurant setting. By using Seaborn, a powerful visualization library in Python, the aim is to uncover patterns and insights that could inform decision-making for restaurant management.
### Data Understanding
Data Source: The dataset used in this project, tips.csv, contains information about total bills, tips, customer gender, smoking status, day, time, and party size. These variables are key to understanding the factors that influence tipping behavior.
Initial Data Inspection:
First 5 rows of the dataset were inspected to get an overview of the data.
Last 5 rows were checked to confirm the data's structure and to look for any irregularities.
### Data Preparation
Data Cleaning: The data was checked for any missing values and outliers that might skew the analysis.
Feature Selection: Key variables like total_bill, tip, sex, smoker, day, time, and size were selected for visualization to analyze their impact on tipping behavior.
### Modeling (Data Visualization)
Swarm Plots:
Visualized tip amounts by day of the week using a swarm plot to observe any day-wise patterns in tipping.
A second swarm plot was created with custom colors to differentiate between genders.
Violin Plots:
Used violin plots to show the distribution of tip amounts and total bills by gender.
FacetGrid Visualizations:
FacetGrids were employed to create a grid of plots based on different combinations of variables like time of day and gender.
Plots included histograms of tip amounts and scatter plots showing the relationship between total bills and tips.
Heatmaps:
A random dataset was generated, and a heatmap was used to visualize it, demonstrating Seabornâ€™s capability for creating heatmaps.
5. Evaluation
Insights:
Tip vs. Day: No significant day-wise trend was observed, but the swarm plot revealed the distribution of tips across different days.
Gender Influence: The customized swarm plot suggested a difference in tipping behavior between male and female customers.
Total Bill vs. Tip: The scatter plots in the FacetGrid revealed a positive correlation between total bills and tips, consistent across different times and genders.
Heatmap Utility: The heatmap visualization demonstrated how Seaborn can be used to understand the distribution and intensity of data points in a matrix format.
